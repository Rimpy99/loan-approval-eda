# Loan approval - Exploratory data analysis + model evaluation

The main goal of this notebook is to find a machine learning model that best performs classification of loan approval status.

## Features

- EDA
    - Data Cleaning.
    - Data Visualization.
    - Feature Engineering.
    - Statistical Summary.
  
- model evaluation
  - Find the dependent variable of the dataset (loan_status).
  - Split the data into predictors (X) and target variable (y).
  - Split the X and y datasets into training and testing sets.
  - Train various machine learning models to evaluate their performance.
  - Determine the best model for the dataset.
